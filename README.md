#Installation
------------

To get started:
* We highly recommend that you setup a web server locally on your machine. Having the ability to test your code locally is invaluable. [XAMPP](http://www.apachefriends.org/index.html), is a great easy to use utility with everything you will need to run PHP, MySQL and of course Apache.
* Once XAMPP is installed, find a tutorial online to setup a virtual host. This will allow you access your test site via URL. For instance, 'http://tamuhack'
