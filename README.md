#tamuHack-www
============
#####Note, this codebase contains sensitive encryption algorithms. Do not share.

A collection of codebases created at hackathons by Texas A&M University students. Oftentimes a web based framework with database is required to complete a hack. This project is intended to provide the means to easily scale a web based framework quickly and keep track of other source files and projects. This project was also founded to encourage other students to learn some new technologies outside of their curriculum.

#Installation
------------

To get started:
* We highly recommend that you setup a web server locally on your machine. Having the ability to test your code locally is invaluable. [XAMPP](http://www.apachefriends.org/index.html), is a great easy to use utility with everything you will need to run PHP, MySQL and of course Apache.
* Once XAMPP is installed, find a tutorial online to setup a virtual host. This will allow you access your test site via URL. For instance, 'http://tamuhack'
