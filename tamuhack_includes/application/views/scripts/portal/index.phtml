<h1>Important Notice</h1>
<p>Welcome to the tamuHack portal! Over the coming months we will be scaling up a ton of awesome tools to 
help us get to hackathons as well as a couple really cool systems which will be outlined below. One of 
the most critical items on the list at the moment is being able to show other schools how many tamuHacker's 
want to attend their event. If we can show that we have a solid number of possible attendees, we can get 
busses sent to TAMU for free rides to-and-from the events. How cool is that? Be sure to get your fellow 
TAMU buddies to signup on the site.  This is a win-win process! Hackathons need to prove to sponsors they 
have people willing to come and as a result we can get free transport. As always, if you want to get in 
touch with us -drop an email, support@tamuhack.com.</p>
<p>Thanks, -tamuHack</p>
